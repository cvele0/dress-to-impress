# Dress to Impress

Dress to Impress is a web application that allows users to virtually try on clothes without needing to visit a store in person. Developed during the **HackUPC**, a 36-hour hackathon in Barcelona, it was part of a challenge organised by *Inditex*. The original challenge was to find the most similar piece of clothing to a selected one. We enhanced this with a feature enabling users to try on clothes virtually by uploading a picture of themselves, where a machine learning model overlays the garment onto the user.

## Features

- **Virtual Try-On**: Upload a photo and see how clothes look on you.
- **Similarity Search**: Find clothing items similar to your chosen piece.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy and intuitive navigation.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Advanced ML models for accurate virtual try-ons.

## Acknowledgments

- **HackUPC**: For organising the hackathon where this project was conceived.
- **Inditex**: For providing the challenge and inspiration for this project.
